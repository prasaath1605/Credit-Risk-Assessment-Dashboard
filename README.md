# 📊 Credit Risk Assessment and Loan Decision Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **customer financial behavior** to assess credit risk and support **data-driven loan approval decisions**.

Using **Python (Pandas)** for data preprocessing and **Power BI** for visualization, the dashboard provides insights into customer credit profiles, financial stress indicators, and loan approval strategies.

The objective of this project is to help financial institutions:

• Identify risky borrowers
• Understand customer financial behavior
• Apply risk-based pricing strategies
• Improve loan approval decision making

# 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains financial information for approximately **3000 customers**.

Key variables include:

* Credit Score
* Annual Income
* Credit Utilization Ratio
* EMI to Income Ratio
* Outstanding Debt
* Payment Delay
* Credit History Age
* Interest Rate
* Loan Approval Status

These variables help evaluate **customer creditworthiness and repayment capacity**.

---

# 🧹 Data Preparation

Before building the dashboard, the dataset was cleaned and processed using **Python and Pandas**.

Steps performed:

• Handling missing values
• Removing duplicate records
• Correcting data types
• Standardizing categorical variables
• Creating new analytical features

---

# ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Several new features were created to improve analysis.

**EMI to Income Ratio**
Measures repayment burden relative to income.

**Credit Utilization Ratio**
Indicates how much credit a customer is using.

**Risk Category**
Customers were classified into:

* Low Risk
* Medium Risk
* High Risk

**Loan Approval Status**

Customers were categorized into:

* Approve
* Review
* Reject

This simulates a **real-world credit approval workflow**.

# 📈 Key Insights

• Majority of customers fall under the Low Risk segment.

• High Risk customers show higher payment delays and outstanding debt exposure.

• Approved customers demonstrate lower EMI burden and lower delay frequency, indicating financial stability.

• Risk-based pricing is observed where high-risk customers receive higher interest rates.

• The loan approval strategy balances credit growth and risk control by approving financially stable customers while placing medium-risk customers under review.
